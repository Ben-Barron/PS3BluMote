(Formally named "PS3 Remote Application")

This application allows you to use the official Sony PS3 Bluetooth remote
control (and other compatible remotes) within windows. The remote simulates
a keyboard whereby each button can be assigned one or many keyboard keys.
When you press a key on the remote, the application simulates the keyboard
key presses.


=====================

INSTALLATION AND USE:

    1. If it is not installed already, download and install .NET 4.0
       framework. This can be downloaded for free here:
       http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851.
    2. Download and install the PS3BluMote application from: 
       http://benbarron.com/applications.
    3. Pair the remote (see instructions below).
    4. Open the PS3BluMote application. The icon for the application will
       appear in the system tray. A grey icon means the remote is not
       connected; blue means connected.
    5. Right-click on the system tray icon and click "Settings". Here
       you can change all the settings needed and the key assignments. You
       can close this window by clicking the "X" in the top right-hand
       corner. You settings will automatically be saved.    
    6. To exit the application you will need to right-click on the system
       tray icon and click "Exit".

HOW TO PAIR THE OFFICIAL SONY PS3 BLUETOOTH REMOTE IN WINDOWS:

    1. Bring up the Bluetooth pairing screen on your computer. How you do
       this depends entirely on your operating system and what Bluetooth
       adapter you are using.
    2. Put the PS3 Bluetooth Remote into pairing mode. To do this you hold 
       "Start + Enter" buttons together for 5 seconds and then release.
    3. Search for discoverable devices on your computer.
    4. When the remote (it is named "BD Remote Control") is found, pair the
       device. If prompted for a key, opt for the NO KEY (or similar) option.
    5. Allow for the device to pair. Do NOT close the "finished paring screen"
       for 2 minutes. Hopefully it should install some drivers in the
       background (see your system tray).
    6. Open the PS3BluMote application and see if the remote works, pressing
       any button should pair the remote automatically. If it works you will
       have a blue icon in your system tray and when you hover over the icon
       for the application it will pop-up with "Connected".
       
If it does not work, continue with these steps:

    7. Put the remote back into pairing mode (follow instruction 2).
    8. Open up the services screen for the already paired remote.
    9. **HOPEFULLY** you should see a checkbox for HID device (or something 
       similar). Check it and click Apply/Ok and it should install the driver.
       
If you are still having issues continue with these steps:

   10. Unplug your PS3 (if you own one).
   11. Un-pair/Remove any PS3 related Bluetooth devices that are paired with
       your computer.
   12. Remove the drivers for your PC Bluetooth device/dongle and remove the 
       actual device itself.
   13. Look through Device Manager to ensure that all drivers/devices related
       to Bluetooth have been removed.
   14. Restart your computer.
   15. Plug the Bluetooth device/dongle back into your PC and install the 
       drivers.
   16. Restart your computer.
   17. Return to Step 1.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ):

---> Can I get my PS3 Bluetooth Remote to launch programs with PS3BluMote?

Yes, you can! You first need to assign a keyboard shortcut to that program in
Windows; you can find instructions here: 

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/Create-keyboard-shortcuts-to-open-programs

You then assign the same keyboard shortcut to a remote button in PS3BluMote 
and everytime you press the button it will open the application.


---> The hibernation feature is disabled, is there any way to save battery use?

Many people have reported a program called Ps3RemoteSleep works to disconnect the
remote. It is a program that you can assign a keyboard shortcut to (see the above
question) and assign a button on your remote to execute it to disable the remote.

Ps3RemoteSleep is available here: http://ps3remotesleep.codeplex.com/


---> Do other remotes work?

The following remotes are known to work:
   - Official Sony PS3 Bluetooth remote (old version).
   - Official Sony PS3 Bluetooth remote (new version).
   - SMK 3700
   - Logitech Harmony (with PS3 Adapter).
   
To get these addition remotes (and any other PS3 Bluetooth remote) to work, you
need to open the PS3BluMote settings and click on the "Settings" tab. Here you 
change the remote VID (Vendor ID) and PID (Product ID) to match your remote. You
can find these in the Device Manager (via Control Panel), however, there is also
a list of VIDs/PIDs for the above remotes on the "Settings" tab page. If you find
another remote that works with PS3BluMote, please let me know via the contact form
here: Http://www.benbarron.com/contact
